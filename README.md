# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
- The Gaming room is a client who was interested to different approaches they can use as they expand their game onto various operating systems. I then explained the integration of the client’s game in a distributed environment. I explain also how to apply the client’s needs to the architectures of the different operating platforms available.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
- I believe my ability to showcase each concern of the client was a highlight as well as the organization of the document was key. It is essential to address each concern of the client and explain the possible solutions and problems that may arise for each scenario to accurately visualize or decide on what to do next. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
- Working through a design document before developing code can provide a structured and organized approach to software development. It can help ensure that all stakeholders involved in the project have a common understanding of the project goals, requirements, and design before any coding is done. This can help reduce miscommunication and misunderstandings that could lead to errors and delays in the development process.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
- I would revise the comaprion chart to create a more appealing UX/UI experience onto a separate presentation. This would include adding additional information to fit in.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
- Considering user needs is essential when designing software because it ensures that the software is usable, effective, and satisfies the user's goals and requirements. By designing with the user in mind, the software is more likely to be adopted and used successfully, which in turn can lead to increased user satisfaction and loyalty.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
- Some techniques I use to analyze and design a software application would be covering requirements set, analysis, creating a prototype and pseudocode, using an agile development approach, and testing and evaluating.
